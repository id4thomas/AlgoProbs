# Edit Distance
counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other

## Types of Edit distance
| Type | Allows |
| -------- | ------ |
| [Levenshtein Distance](#levenshtein-distance) | deletion, insertion, substitution |
| [Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)](#longest-common-subsequence-lcs) | deletion, insertion |
| Hamming Distance | substitution |
| Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance | insertion, deletion, substitution, transposition (adjacent)|
| Jaro Distance | transposition |

### Levenshtein Distance
